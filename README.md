All the documentation done throughout the project of Analysis of Covid-19. This was done working in a team of 4.

The project began with research about when the nations went into lockdowns, what was the vaccination rate and how daily reporting of cases was.

Null and alternative hypothesis were formulated and tests were conducted. To support the results of the tests, we designed visualizations in Tableau.
The Final report contains the details of the research along with the inferences
